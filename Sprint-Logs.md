# Sprint 1 (Tuesday: 11:22am - Wednesday 12:30pm)

Overview: The purpose of this sprint was to make a start on creating tests that satisfy the user stories created in the planning process. We split off into sub-groups and assigned tickets to each group, three of the four groups had 2 tickets to complete by the sprints end, and one of the group was dealing with the *EPIC* associated with the quickest path.

Review:
Positives- 

Toward the end of the sprint once we figured out the framework, we were gaining momentum with completing tickets.

As a group we understood the Sprints more, as Jira requires more structured sprints. This meant that we couldn't end a sprint            and start a new one.

Our sprint planning was really strong, this set us up for an easier time during the time.
           
Improvements- 

Throughout the first sprint we had a breakdown in communication once the sub-groups had gone off and started their                       tickets. We need to improve this so that anyone at any point when asked can say what they are doing and what everyone is                 doing.     

We were running into the issue where we sometimes didn't understand the task/ticket that we were undertaking. This slowed               down our process quite considerably.
              
Not having concise user stories so they were getting misconstrued between groups and would need further clarification
from the author of the user story.

# Sprint 2 (Wednesday 12:30pm - Thursday 9:00am)

Overview: This sprint was designed in order to work through as many of the outstanding tickets as possible. The group were split into different groups than the previous sprint and given a small amount of tickets to complete, with extra being pulled from the backlog if completed.

Review: 
Positives - 

Group work was improved, with more people moving around helping each other

Less relient on Emese for help with git

Better communication and awareness of what other individuals were working on

Sprint was better planned than previous ones

Improvements -

JIRA was poorly used - very few updates, checking of it - most planning done on wall

Code is messy with a lot of chained methods and feature files needing reorganisation

Merging took a lot more work than expected so more time should be allocated for that

# Sprint 3 (Thursday 12:30pm - Friday 9:00am)

Overview: The purpose of this sprint was to focus on refactoring. We realised that not everyone was following the same conventions when creating features, stepdefs and page models. The sprint goal was to have a complete end product and get through as many slides as possible.


Review:
Positives- 

We got through nine tickets 

Had good momentum throughout the sprint
           
Improvements- 

Sprint planning took longer than expected due to the group being distracted, sprint start was delayed.

Most of the group didn't use Jira to track their tickets. Tickets had to be manually moved by others rather than the individuals handling the ticket.

Our communication had regressed quite a bit, it was similar to the first day of the project. I think the group got complacement and comfortable, but the main thing is we finished the day strong
